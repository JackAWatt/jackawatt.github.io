* courses
[abstract]
My main goal for 2020 is to pass the OSCP or PTP. I'm combining multiple
approaches I've seen over the years to learn a set of subjects to meet a goal.

[korbonits' 2018 and 2019 post](http://korbonits.github.io/) inspired creating
persriptions to attain goals throughout the year, and using OKR to measure my
progres. The OKR style is that attaining roughly 70% is the perfect outcome.
Hitting 100% in 2020 means I should set larger goals in 2021. Hitting 50% means
I should set smaller goals. The way I'm going to choose to
intupret this is that I'm going to set a lot of goals. I'm going to set a
number where I feel if I really focus I could attain, but most likely I'll hit
70-80%. This doesn't mean I should attain 70% on a test, but that I should ace
70% of the topics I take on. And then hopefully something like 15% I'll abandon
for not being advanced enough, and the other 15% will be things too
advanced that I'll have to push forward until I'm ready to undertake the task. 

The other post that inspired writing this is
[Azeria's the importance of deep work the 30 hour method for learning a new skill](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/). The way I'm going to determine if something is going to work for me, is going to be to put 30 hours in, and then determine if I think investing more time will get me closer to the goal. For example I'm going to start [@TheCyberMentor](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor)'s [Practical Ethical Hacking course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking), and after investing 30 hours I'll determine how much benefit I think I'm getting towards the OSCP. I'll do the same thing with material--to be choosen later--on security+, network+, CCNA, etc. I want to pass the OSCP on the first try. This is my highest priority for 2020. Taking on security+, network+, and CCNA, are only to build out a solid security and networking foundation, or at least as good of one that I am possible of in 12 months. Not taking the exams will allow me to move through these topics in a non-linear fashion.

By the end of 2020 I should be done with the OSCP. I should have a better idea
of what certifications or trainings will be most beneficial.
[this video](https://youtu.be/sSXhF0C0QlI?t=776) that "it's very simliar to the
OSCP, not nearly as difficult". The impression I'm getting is that the PTP is
better training and more practical, but the OSCP is harder. As of right now my
plan is to to take advantage of as many free and cheap options as possible
before commiting to either taking the OSCP or PTP. TJ Null completed the PTS/PTP
and still went on to write the OSCP. I think I would be more willing to take
the obscure training, if the certifcation were more difficult than the OSCP.

# 30 hour method
I'm setting up courses, projects, tasks, etc, broken up into several 3 to 4
hour sessions. The goal is to put in 30 hours before judging if the skill
should be continued with. Quiting material early if it is too advanced or not
advanced enough is fine, but material should be abandoned early, skills should
be continued on with until the 30 hours is up. 

# OKR
OKRS will provide a reference to evaluate how well i did in executing my
objectives. This will create data to help track my progress, and be able to
determine if I need to take on less or more. 

# schedule
I will take on 2-3 courses at once, 1 project, 1 challange site.

# What I was doing before that was not working


### week 1
* security foundations


# courses
* [@TheCyberMentor](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor)'s [Practical Ethical Hacking course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking)

# certs
* PTP or OSCP
Will be determined when I finish [@TheCyberMentor](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor)'s [Practical Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking)
# reading
## technical books
* the phoenix project
* hacking exposed
* web application
## technical articles
## Free Videos
[Black Hills Information Security 5 year plan](https://youtu.be/Uv-AfK7PkxU)

## CTF

# hackthebox

# projects
* write conway's game of life and a reverse polish notation calculator in 10
  programming languages. 
   (c,c++,ruby,python,perl,haskell,elixir,erlang,php,javascript)

* create 3 video tutorials

* technical writing. 

These will be about documenting what is working for me and what isn't. At the
end of 2020 I will have kept track of my progress, and will be able to bring
things foward to 2021 that weren't accomplished.
