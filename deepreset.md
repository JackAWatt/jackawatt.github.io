Deep Reset

My plan is to attain a broad general education. This will include taking courses through eDx and other online platforms, reading the great books, learning to write, etc. 

I have compiled a list of resources that include several computer science, math, data science curiculums. 

There is a list of great literature, and a list of philosophy. Both of these lists are meant to give a chronological introduction.

There is a section with Information Security courses and learning platforms, CTF and hacking challenges, coding challenges, etc. 

December:

Advent of Code, TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber, and Sans Holiday Hack all run at the same time. Most of december is going to spent on these three events, but I'll also start reading Plato at the Googleplex, The Illiad, and How to Read a Book and Why - Bloom. I might also start How to Read a Book by Adler. 

Success for me would mean that in 1 years time would mean progress in the math, cs, data science curiculums, finish more paths on tryhackme, progress towards the literature and philosophy reading lists, language progress on codewars and exercism, progress towards the interview prep kit on hackerrank, progress on hackthebox, networking/pentesting on INE's platform, rangeforce cyber's free community edition, web security academy, etc. 

Essentially success means seeing progress in math, computer science, information security, reading literature, etc.
