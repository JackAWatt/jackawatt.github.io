## ARM Exploitation
* 7 x 4 hour sessions
* layed out by Azeria in [the importance of deep work & the 30-hour method for learning a new skill](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/)
* comfortability with subject: very low
* this document is going to change to include notes from the sessions. [unmodified found here](https://github.com/JackAWatt/Free-Parking/blob/b1e3e6de59e06fea9d470eded551776fc2b9d1c1/docs/thirty-hour/ARM-exploitation/sessions.md)
## sessions 1: Information Gathering and Reading

* Read [Introduction to Assembly Basics](https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-assembly-part-1/) tutorial(1- 7)
* Read the section about [Process Memory and Memory Corruptions on
  ARM](https://azeria-labs.com/process-memory-and-memory-corruption/)
* Go through the [Exploitation on Arm-based
  Systems](https://github.com/sashs/arm_exploitation) slides by Sascha Schirra
* Read about writing ARM shellcode ([Execve Shell](https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-shellcode/), [Bind Shell](https://azeria-labs.com/tcp-bind-shell-in-assembly-arm-32-bit/), [Reverse Shell](https://azeria-labs.com/tcp-reverse-shell-in-assembly-arm-32-bit/)) if you want to use your own shellcode
* Have the [ARM reference
  manual](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0068b/index.html) handy in case you need to look something up

## Session 2: Setting up the Environment & Goal Setting

* Set up ARM environment. download the [Azeria-Labs Lab VM](https://azeria-labs.com/arm-lab-vm/) - probably opt for the manual route
* Get familiar with [GDB/GEF](https://azeria-labs.com/debugging-with-gdb-introduction/)
* Use the rest of the time to google and look up the usage of common tools like objdump, strace, as, ld.

## Session 3: First Steps – start simple

* Start practicing with simple Stack Overflow challenges and read [this guide on how to get started](https://azeria-labs.com/part-3-stack-overflow-challenges/). You can get the source code from [exploit-exercises.com](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/) and compile them inside your ARM environment

## Session 4: Continue with Session 3 if not completed

## Session 5: Solve ARM challenges

* Once you’re done with simple stack overflow challenges, you can get more advanced challenges at [root-me.org](https://www.root-me.org/?page=recherche&lang=en&recherche=ARM)

## Session 6: Continue solving advanced challenges

## Session 7: Continue solving advanced challenges
