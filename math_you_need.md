Everything here is taken from [Zach Star](https://youtu.be/PNbwH63ezHw)'s [How to Take all the Math Classes You Need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-hSdO5Tm9Nc6E4GobZZlwD0MNfCUAnHHEDqkypDtx0/edit) google doc. 

#### Precalculus/Algebra 2 & Trigonometry:
* [Pre-Calculus Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwRPH0JrFY&list=PL4FB17E5C77DCCE69&index=1)
* [Trig Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABDKOmamIwo&list=PL085526F86A268B57)
    * These are also in the pre-calc lectures from above (same person and playlist) but I listed it separately because some people take classes that are specifically on trigonometry and this way you don't have to go searching through the playlist.
* [Pre-Calc/Algebra 2 Assignments (With Solutions)](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/Alg/Alg.aspx)
* [Pre-Calc/Algebra 2 Assignments (Without Solutions)](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/Alg/Alg.aspx)
