How to Take all the Math Classes You Need

*Important Change: Lots of textbooks in PDF form can easily be found online with a google search. That was how I found plenty of the one's that I did. However I am going to stay on the cautious side due to copyright issues and only list the book's name and author rather than the link and you can do a search (or even buy the book if you want) yourself. Some textbooks are still linked because they are available on sites like MIT. 
Precalculus/Algebra 2 & Trigonometry:
Pre-Calculus Lectures
Trig Lectures
These are also in the pre-calc lectures from above (same person and playlist) but I listed it separately because some people take classes that are specifically on trigonometry and this way you don't have to go searching through the playlist.
Pre-Calc/Algebra 2 Assignments (With Solutions)
Pre-Calc/Algebra 2 Assignments (Without Solutions)
Trigonometry Assignments

*Schools will differ a little in what is taught in pre-calculus, often it's pretty much the same material you learn in algebra 2 which is why I listed this section as both. I listed the trigonometry lectures separately because sometimes people take classes that are specifically on that subject. 
 
Single Variable Calculus/Calculus 1/Calculus AB (Pre-req: Pre-Calculus or Algebra 2):
Which Majors Take This Class: All Engineers, Computer Science, Math, Most Sciences (Physics, Chem, Bio, etc), Business (they usually take 'business calc' which is very similar).

Lectures (Professor Leonard: First Choice)
Lectures (MIT Opencourseware)
Assignments (With solutions)
Assignments (Without solutions)
Textbook (First Choice): "Calculus" by Ron Larson
This textbook can be used for Calc 1-3 and I have listed this one for all of those lectures below.
Textbook (Second Choice: Listed on MIT Site)
This textbook can be used for Calc 1-3 and I have listed this one for all of those lectures below.
 
 
Calc 2 (Pre-req: Calc 1):
Which Majors Take This Class: All Engineers, Computer Science, Math, Physics, Chemistry

Lectures (Professor leonard: First Choice)
Lectures (Same as MIT lecture playlist from above)
MIT kind of combined calculus 1&2 into one playlist. So this link will start off at lecture 27 which is a typical starting point for a calc 2 class. 
Assignments (with solutions)
Assignments (without solutions)
Textbook (First Choice: Same as Calc 1 from above): "Calculus" by Ron Larson
This textbook can be used for Calc 1-3
Textbook (Listed on MIT site, same as Calc 1)
This textbook can be used for Calc 1-3
 
Multivariable Calculus/Calc 3 (Pre-req: Calc 2):
Which Majors Take This Class: All Engineers, Computer Science, Math, Physics, Chemistry

Lectures (Professor Leonard: First Choice)
One thing to note about these lectures is that they are much longer than the one's listed below at MIT.
Lectures (MIT opencourseware)
Assignments (With solutions)
Assignments (Without Solutions)
Textbook (First Choice: Same as Calc 1&2 from above): "Calculus" by Ron Larson
This textbook can be used for Calc 1-3
Textbook (Listed on MIT site, same as Calc 1)
This textbook can be used for Calc 1-3
 
Differential Equations (Pre-Req: Calc 1&2, Co-req Calc 3):
Which Majors Take This Class: All Engineers, Some Computer Science Majors (depends on school), Math, Physics

Lectures (MIT Opencourseware)
Assignments (With Solutions)
These go along with the lecture
More Practice Problems (w/ notes)
There aren't official assignment problems here like for Calc 1-3, but there are example problems that are explained that you can use as practice problems. 
Textbook: "Elementary differential equations" by Henry Edwards and David Penney 
 
Linear Algebra (Pre-Req: Calculus 3):
Which Majors Take This Class: All Engineers, Computer Science, Math, Physics. 

Lectures (MIT Opencourseware)
Assignments With Solutions
The solutions also contain the questions themselves
Textbook: "Linear Algebra and it's Applications 4th edition" by Gilbert Strang
 
Discrete Math (Pre-req: Calculus 1):
Which Majors Take This Class: Computer Science, Math, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, some Physics Majors (depends on the school). 

Lectures (MIT Opencourseware)
Assignments (Without Solutions)
These assignments go along with the lecture but don't contain solutions
Assignments (with solutions but don't go exactly with lecture)
These assignments are from ANOTHER year this course was taught (same material mostly but different order), but they do have solutions. So you might need to do a little searching sometimes to match up exactly what is taught in the lecture vs what the homework is.
Textbook
 
*This class is listed as "mathematics for computer science" but pretty much all the material covered is what math majors will see in their discrete math/proofs class (logic, proofs, number theory, graph theory, etc).  You also do NOT need computer science experience to take this class and can take it anytime after calc 1.
 
Real Analysis (Pre-req: Discrete Math & Linear Algebra): 
Which Majors Take This Class: Math

Lectures (Harvey Mudd)
Assignments (Match Lecture but not very good)
These assignments are directly from the lecture, but are a little harder to follow and are less organized.
Assignments With Solutions (From MIT Site)
These don't match the lecture exactly but are more organized and contain solutions
Textbook: "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" by Walter Rudin
 
Complex Analysis (Pre-req: Calc 3, Recommended: Linear Algebra & Discrete Math):
Which Majors Take This Class: Math, Some Electrical Engineers (depends on school), some physics majors (depends on school but recommended if you are going into physics for grad school). 

Lectures 
Assignments With Solutions
Textbook: "Complex Analysis" by Gamelin
 
 
Abstract Algebra (Pre-Req: Linear Algebra & Discrete Math):
Which Majors Take This Class: Math, some physics majors (depends on school)

Lectures (Liberty College)
These lectures match the assignments below but I listed two sets of lectures so you can choose your favorite
Lectures (Harvard)
Lecture Notes and Practice Problems
These go with the liberty college lectures. Currently cannot find assignments for the Harvard one's.
Solutions to Problems (and some test examples)
Textbook: "Contemporary Abstract Algebra" by Joseph Gallian
 
 
General Topology (Pre-req: Real analysis, Co-req: Abstract Algebra)
Which Majors Take this Class: Math

Lectures
Couldn't find an actual university lecture but these still do a pretty good job
Assignments (No Solutions)
You need the textbook to see what the problems are
Textbook: "Topology" by James Munkres
