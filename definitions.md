#### Geometry:
* What is the shape of a point?

In Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion upon which geometry is built. Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. In particular, the geometric points do not have length, area, volume, or any other dimensional attribute. A common point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space.

* Ray

In geometry, a "ray" is a part of a line that starts at a particular point and extends infinitely in one direction. It has one endpoint and goes on forever in one direction.

***

* Origin

In geometry, the term "origin" typically refers to a specific point in a coordinate system, often denoted as the point (0, 0). The coordinate system is a reference framework used to locate points in space. In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the origin is where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. The coordinates of the origin are (0, 0), and it serves as the starting point for measuring distances and locating other points.

In a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, there is also a z-axis, and the origin is the point where all three axes intersect. The coordinates of the three-dimensional origin are (0, 0, 0).

The choice of the origin is arbitrary, but once it is established, it provides a consistent reference point for describing the positions of other points in the coordinate system. Coordinates are typically given as ordered pairs (for two dimensions) or ordered triples (for three dimensions), indicating the distances along each axis from the origin to the point in question.

* Dialation

Dilations are a type of non-rigid transformation. They change the size of a shape by scaling it up or down, making it bigger or smaller. Unlike rigid transformations, dilations do not keep the shape's size the same.

***

* Translation

In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right. Translations only move things from one place to another; they don't change their size, arrangement, or direction.

***

* Rotation

In geometry, a rotation is a transformation that turns a figure or object around a fixed point known as the center of rotation. The object remains the same shape and size, but it is repositioned in space by a certain angle. The center of rotation is the point that stays fixed during the rotation, and the distance from any point on the object to the center of rotation remains constant.
