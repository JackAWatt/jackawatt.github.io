## Math:

#### Geometry:
* What is the shape of a point?

In Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion upon which geometry is built. Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. In particular, the geometric points do not have length, area, volume, or any other dimensional attribute. A common point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space.

* Ray

In geometry, a "ray" is a part of a line that starts at a particular point and extends infinitely in one direction. It has one endpoint and goes on forever in one direction.
