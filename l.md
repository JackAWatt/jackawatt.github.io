$$v = u + at$$

$$68 = 5.0 + a(15)$$

$$68 = 5.0 + a(15)$$

$a = \frac {v-u}{t}$

$a = \frac {68-5.0}{15}$

$a = \frac {63.0}{15}$

$a = 4.2$




An object originally travelling at 5.0 m/s accelerates uniformly for 15 seconds. If
the speed of this object is 68 m/s after this time interval, how far did it travel
during the 15-second acceleration period?
