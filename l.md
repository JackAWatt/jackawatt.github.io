You wish to slide a puck up an icy frictionless incline. The puck has a mass of 500 g and the incline is 5.0 m high. What initial speed must you give the puck in order for it to just reach the top of the incline?

The initial speed of the puck must be 9.9 m/s for it to just reach the top of the incline. 

{

m = 500 g = 0.5 kg
h = 5.0 m

KE_i = PE_f

KE = 1/2*mv^2
PE = mgh


1/2mv^2 = mgh
1/2*v^2 = gh
v^2 = 2gh
v = sqrt(2gh)

v = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 5.0 m)
v = sqrt(98)
v = 9.8994949366
v = 9.9 m/s

}
