# 47

A beam of light is shone from air into a block of zircon at an angle of 45.0°. The refracted beam is measured to have an angle of 22.0°. The index of refraction for air is 1.00.  What is the index of refraction of zircon? (2 points)

the index of refraction of zircon is approximately 1.89

{

n1 sin(θ1) = n2 sin(θ2) 

n1 = 1.00
θ1 = 45.0°
θ2 = 22.0°

1.00 * sin(45.0°) = n2 * sin(22.0°)
0.7071067811 = n2 * 0.3746065934
n2 = 0.7071067811 / 0.3746065934

n2 = 1.8875983326

n2 = 1.89
