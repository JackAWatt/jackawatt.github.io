A 2150 kg truck is travelling along a highway where the posted speed limit is 20 m/s. The driver fully applies the brakes and comes to a stop, leaving a skid mark 35 m long. The coefficient of friction between the tires and the road is 0.28. Using physics, determine if the driver was speeding before he slammed on his brakes. Show all work for full marks. 

The truck was truck was travelling at 13.86 m/s when it applied the brake, which is slower than the posted speed limit. The driver was not speeding. 

{

m = 2150 kg

Fn = m * g

Fn = 2150 * 9.8 m/s^2
Fn = 21070 N

Ff = Î¼ * Fn
Ff = 0.28 * 21070
Ff = 5899.6 N

Wf = Ff * d
Wf = 5899.6 N * 35 m = 206486 J

1/2*mv^2 = Wf

1/2*mv^2 = 206486 J
mv^2 = 2 * 206486
v^2 = (2 * 206486) / 2150 kg
v^2 = 192.08
v = sqrt(192.08)
v = 13.8592929113
v = 13.86 m/s
