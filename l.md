1. The area of a rectangular field is $2275m^2$. The field is enclosed by $200m$ of fencing.
What are the dimensions of the field?

a. Area
$$2275 = L \times W$$

b. Perimiter
$$200 = 2 \times (L + W)$$
$$100 = L + W$$

Solving for W. 
$$100 -W = L$$
$$-w = L -100$$
$$w = 100 -L$$

Solving for L.
$$100 -L = W$$
$$-L = -100 + w$$
$$L = 100 -W$$

Substitute one of the expressions into the first equation.
$$2275 = L \times (100 -L)$$
$$2275 = 100L - L^2$$

Rearrange into standard form.
$$100L - L^2 = 2275$$
$$100L - L^2 - 2275 = 0$$
$$-L^2 + 100L - 2275 = 0$$
I was going to leave $L^2$ negative, but ran into some issues with the quadratic formula which went away when I divded everything by -1
$$L^2 - 100L + 2275 = 0$$
Solve for L.
$$L = \frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
$$L = \frac {-(-100) \pm \sqrt{(-100)^2 - 4(1)(2275)}}{2(1)}$$
$$L = \frac {-(-100) \pm \sqrt{10000 - 9100}}{2}$$
$$L = \frac {-(-100) \pm \sqrt{900}}{2}$$
$$L = \frac {100 \pm 30}{2}$$

Working out the two possible values for L

1.
$$L = \frac {100 + 30}{2}$$
$$L = \frac {130}{2}$$

$$L = 65$$

2.
$$L = \frac {100 - 30}{2}$$
$$L = \frac {70}{2}$$

$$L = 35$$


$35 \times 65 = 2275 \therefore$ the dimensions of the field are $Length = 65$ and $Width = 35$

2. The product of two consecutive even numbers is 168. What are the numbers?

We can find the first $x$ value by working out $x$, and then the second value will be $x+2$
$$2x+2 = 168$$
$$2x = 166$$
$$\frac {2x}{2} = \frac {166}{2}$$
$$x = 83$$
$83+85 = 168 \therefore$ the two consecutive even numbers are $83$ and $85$

3. A toy rocket is fired off the ground at a target 24 feet away. It is designed to reach a
maximum height of 36 feet as it heads toward its target on a parabolic path. Find the
equation that represents the height off the ground versus the distance travelled for this
rocket. State the equation in standard form, $𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐$. HINT: The path of the
rocket is an “upside down” parabola, with one of the x-intercepts at the origin and the
other at $(24,0)$. We also know the y-value of the vertex. We can use this information to
find $a$, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term. One way to find this is to plug the known values into the factored form of the equation, ie. $𝑦 = 𝑎(𝑥 − 𝑟)(𝑥 − 𝑠)$

4. A plane traveled from Moncton to Winnipeg, a distance of $1940km$. On the return
trip, the plane’s speed increased by $100km/h$ due to a tailwind. The total round trip took 6 hours. Find the average speed of the plane in each part of its journey, i.e. on the way to Winnipeg, and on the way back to Moncton.

let $t_{w} =$ time to Winnepeg, $t_{m} =$ time to Moncton ,  $s = speed$

a. Trip to Winnipeg

$$t_{w} \times s = 1940$$
$$t_{w} = \frac {1940}{s}$$

b. Trip to Moncton

$$t_{m} \times (s+100) = 1940$$
$$t_{m} = \frac {1940}{s+100}$$
