Two crates on a frictionless table are connected by a rope. A force of 6.4 N is applied as shown. Assuming a smooth frictionless surface, perform the two calculations below.

 

a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration of the crates. (2 points)

The acceleration of the crates is approximately 2.63 m/s^2

{

f = 6.4 N

m1 = 1.5 kg

m2 = 0.93 kg

m_total = m1 + m2
m_total = 1.5 kg + 0.93 kg
m_total = 2.43 kg

F = ma
a = F/m

a = 6.4 N / 2.43 kg
a = 2.6337448560

a = 2.63 m/s^2

}

b) Calculate the magnitude of the tension, T, in the connecting rope. (2 points)

The magnitude of the tension in the connecting rope is approximately 2.45 N

{

T = m2a
T = 0.93 kg * 2.63 m/s^2

T = 2.4459

T = 2.45 N

}
