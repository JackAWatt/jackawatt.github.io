$$v = u + at$$

$$68 = 5.0 + a(15)$$

$$68 = 5.0 + a(15)$$

$$a = \frac {v-u}{t}$$

$$a = \frac {68-5.0}{15}$$

$$a = \frac {63.0}{15}$$

$$a = 4.2$$

$$68 = 5.0 + (4.2)(15)$$

$$s = ut + \frac {1}{2}at^2$$

$$s = (5.0)(15) + \frac {1}{2}(4.2)(15)^2$$

$$s = 75 + 472.5$$

$$s = 547.5$$




An object originally travelling at 5.0 m/s accelerates uniformly for 15 seconds. If
the speed of this object is 68 m/s after this time interval, how far did it travel
during the 15-second acceleration period?
