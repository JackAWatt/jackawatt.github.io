1. The area of a rectangular field is $2275m^2$. The field is enclosed by $200m$ of fencing.
What are the dimensions of the field?

a. $$2275 = L \times W$$
b. $$200 = 2 \times (L + W)$$
$$100 = L + W$$


2. The product of two consecutive even numbers is 168. What are the numbers?

3. A toy rocket is fired off the ground at a target 24 feet away. It is designed to reach a
maximum height of 36 feet as it heads toward its target on a parabolic path. Find the
equation that represents the height off the ground versus the distance travelled for this
rocket. State the equation in standard form, $𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐$. HINT: The path of the
rocket is an “upside down” parabola, with one of the x-intercepts at the origin and the
other at $(24,0)$. We also know the y-value of the vertex. We can use this information to
find $a$, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term. One way to find this is to plug the known values into the factored form of the equation, ie. $𝑦 = 𝑎(𝑥 − 𝑟)(𝑥 − 𝑠)$

4. A plane traveled from Moncton to Winnipeg, a distance of $1940km$. On the return
trip, the plane’s speed increased by $100km/h$ due to a tailwind. The total round trip took
6 hours. Find the average speed of the plane in each part of its journey, i.e. on the way
to Winnipeg, and on the way back to Moncton.
