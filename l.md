# 46

An ambulance siren emits a frequency of 440 Hz. If the air temperature is 23.0Â°C, calculate the frequency heard by an observer if the ambulance is approaching him at 26.1 m/s.

The frequency heard by the observer is approximately 476 Hz

{

f' = ?
f = 440 Hz
v = 345.2 m/s
v_o = 0 m/s
v_s = 26.1 m/s
T = 23.0 c

v = 331.4 + 0.6 * T
v = 331.4 + 0.6 * 23.0
v = 345.2 m/s

f' = (f*(v+v_o))/(v-v_s)
f' = (440*(345.2+0))/(345.2-26.1)
f' = 475.9887182701
f' = 476 Hz
