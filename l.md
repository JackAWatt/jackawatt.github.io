A trombone reinforces a sound wave of frequency 87 Hz as its first harmonic

(fundamental). This musical instrument functions as an air column open at both ends.  If the speed of sound is 338 m/s, what is the length of the pipe being used? (

The length of the pipe is approximately 1.94 m

{

v = 338 m/s
f = 87 Hz

位 = v/f
位 = 338/87
位 = 3.8850574713

L = 位/2

L = 3.8850574713 / 2
L = 1.9425287357
L = 1.94 m
