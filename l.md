A 200 kg crate is pushed horizontally with a force of 700 N. If the coefficient of friction is 0.20, calculate the acceleration of the crate. 

mass = 200 kg

force = 700 N

coefficient of friction = .2

Fg = 200 * 9.8 = 1960

Fnormal = Fg

Ff = .2 * 1960 = 392

Fnet = 700 - 392 = 308

a = 308/200 = 1.54 m/s^2

$$t \frac {1}{7}$$
