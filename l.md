A 2.0 kg block and a 5.0 kg block are connected by a rope over a frictionless pulley as shown in the image. Find the tension of the cable and the acceleration of the system when released.

The acceleration of the system when released is 4.2 m/s^2 and the tension is 28.0 N

{

m1 = 2.0 kg
m2 = 5.0 kg
T = 28.0 N
a = 4.2 m/s^2

a = (m2*g - m1*g) / (m1 + m2)

a = (5.0 * 9.8 - 2.0 * 9.8) / (2 + 5)
a = 29.4 / 7
a = 4.2 m/s^2

T = m1g + m1a

T = 2.0 * 9.8 + 2.0 * 4.2
T = 28 N

}
