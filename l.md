### A plane with a speed of 12 m/s needs to reach a speed of 38 m/s for takeoff. If there is only 0.66 km of runway left:

* a) at what rate must the plane uniformly accelerate?

The plane must uniformly accelerate at 0.98 m/s^2

{
u = 12 m/s
v = 38 m/s
s = 0.66 km = 660 m

v^2 = u^2 + 2as

a = (v^2 - u^2) / 2s

a = (38^2 - 12^2) / 2*660

a = 0.9848484848

a = 0.98 m/s^2
}
* b) how much time will it need for takeoff?
