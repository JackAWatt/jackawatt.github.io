# 44

A 0.35-kg cart moving along a horizontal surface at 2.5 m/s collides head on with a spring that has a spring constant of 110 N/m. Calculate the maximum compression that the cart will produce in the spring. 

The maximum compression that the cart will produce in the spring is 0.14 m

{

m = 0.35 kg
v = 2.5 m/s

KE = 1/2*mv^2

KE = 1/2*0.35 kg * 2.5 m/s^2
KE = 1.09375 J

Ep = 1/2*kx^2

k = 110 N/m
x = ?

1/2*mv^2 = 1/2*kx^2

mv^2 = kx^2

x^2 = mv^2 / k
x = sqrt(mv^2 / k)

x = sqrt((0.35 * 2.5^2)/110)
x = sqrt(0.0198863636)
x = 0.1410190186
x = 0.14 m
