$$v_f = v_i + at$$

$$12 = v_i  - 3a$$

$$d = v_it + \frac {1}{2}at^2$$


$$60 = v_i(3.0) + \frac {1}{2}a(3.0)^2$$

$$60 = 3v_i -4.5a$$

$$v_i = 12 + 3a$$

$$60 = 3(12 + 3a)  -4.5a$$



a car traveling along a highway must uniformly reduce its speed to 12m/s in
3.0 s. It travels 60 m during that time.
