The main thing I did today was watch the Wildberger video--below, and then thought about how to prove the communitive law to someone who doesn't understand modern language or numbers. I'm not sure the way I came up with works without the explanations around it.

I don't really understand the distrubutive law or why we are using `k`, `m`, or `n`. I'll have to read an explanation of it before I can try to prove it in the same way I did the communitive law.  

# Some thoughts, notes, work from the day: 

## [This Will Make You Better at Math Tests, But You Probably are Not Doing It ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqWqzvnbnjU)

To get better at doing tests the reccomendation is to do the test twice and then compare answers. Being able to solve the problems quickly will allow answering them twice rather than just looking over the answers.

Give reasons why these rules are true:

Prove them true in a way that a 10 year old 100 thousand years ago would understand. Up until this point Wildberger has used lines for counting and has introduced the notation of a succesor function. I should be able to essentially create drawings that I could show to someone who doesn't understand the concept of numbers or speaks a language I understand. 


Here is my attempt at the communitive property:

I'm going to show that n*m=m*n using 4 and 3.

first we show that m(4) groups of n(3) is equal to 12

Then we show that n(3) groups of m(4) is equal to 12

Finally, we show that m(4) groups of n(3) is equal to n(3) groups of m(5) using the method of drawing connections between our lines that represent a unit of 1. 

someone who doesn't know the number 12 should be able to compare m groups of n compared to n groups of m and determine it's the same.

## [Don Knuth - Interview 2006](https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006)
> In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was, you know, I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems. So it was good that I was scared, in a way that I, you know, that made me start strong, and then I could coast afterwards, rather than always climbing and being on a lower part of the learning curve.

## [Someone improved my code by 40,832,277,770%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks)

Stand-up Maths wrote code that ran in 31 days, and then his viewers wrote code to solve the problem faster. The end result is less than 10 miliseconds. some improvements are math based and others have to do with knowing how computers work. The code got so fast that to get it faster they had to start working as they were still reading in the text input.
