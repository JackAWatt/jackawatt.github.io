Today I made some progress on KhanAcademy. I'm almost ready to start the integrated math track that combines algebra 1,2, geometry, and some statistics.

I listened to [John McWhorter on the Evolution of Language and Words on the Move](https://www.econtalk.org/john-mcwhorter-on-the-evolution-of-language-and-words-on-the-move/) - EconTalk. I'm going to add his book to my to-read list.

I started [Cathy O'Neil on Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.econtalk.org/cathy-oneil-on-weapons-of-math-destruction/) - EconTalk. O'Neil talks about recidivism rates being associated with sentencing. She makes good points for algorithmic and data transparency. I'm going to finish the podcast at some point and add the book to my to-read list.

I created weekly [streaks](https://streak.club/u/jsw/streaks-hosted) for Information Security, Computer Science, Math, non-fiction reading, and fiction reading. I don't have a plan on how much time I'll put into each, but I think it might be helpful to track each individually.

the main point of creating these [streaks](https://streak.club/u/jsw/streaks-hosted) is to try to prevent constantly shifting my focus from topic to topic. I heard David Brady say on a Ruby Rogues podcast something along the lines of "some programmers have 10 years of experience and some have 1 year of experience 10 times". I think my inability to stay focused on one or a few topics at once has lead to having 1 year of experience 10 times.
