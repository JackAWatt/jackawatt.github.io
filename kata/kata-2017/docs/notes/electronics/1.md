## Electricity

Electricity is the movement of electrons through a conductor towards a positive force through a good conductor.

Electrons move from negitive to positive terminals. 

`current = I`

`amp year = 6.28 * 10^18 electrons per second`

a good conductor is copper. carbon has 1 electron in its outer shell and 31 empty spaces.



`voltage = V`



## Resistors

How to identify [resistors](http://www.wikihow.com/Identify-Resistors)


## Ohm's Law
```math
V = I * R

I = V / R

R = V / I

P = V * I

P = I^2 * R
```
