## 30 hours to the skill of investing 30 hours to learn a skill
* 15 * 2 hour sessions
* once per week
* it makes sense to not plan all the sessions before starting. The layout on
  ARM exploitation was written by the person who wrote most of the content for
  the sessions. In the future it would make sense to use buffer time between
  sessions to plan the subsequent session. 
 * the point of doing 15 * 2 hour sessions is to get into the habbit of planning out learning paths.
 * I would like to have several plans ready to be picked up at any time. 
 * sessions complete: 1

## session 1: plan out a few sessions towards skills to learn
* ARM exploitation - planning done by azeria. Using as a guide for other skill
  session plans
* math - figure out areas of weakness and plan out sessions around them
* syntopical reading - plan out sessions around reading books/papers with the
  intent of being able to write about the content in my own words

* ### notes
Created directories for the three 30-hour sessions

layed out first few sessions in each doman

I will use the start of each session to plan the rest of that session. This won't be the case for any domain except this one. The rest will include a 15-30 min buffer session to plan out/modify the next session


## session 2: contiue with 3 initial domains and then add a few more
* Unix/Linux - the linux programming interface, looking into the kernal, familiarize with sed, grep, awk, other unix utils
* functional programming - recursion, monads, higher order functions
* video/audio/photo editing - basic photoshop, editing out silence on podcasts, transitions on vidoes, etc
* electronics - GPIO, basics of electronics, arduino/rPi tutorials, putting the case full of electronics to use, figure out what some of the components are for
* data visualization - d3, pandas(I think?), R. Learn some stats first so there is something to visualize
* C/C++ - 21st centuary C, roger sessions book, K&R
* elm
* smalltalk
