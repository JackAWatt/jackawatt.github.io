4. A plane traveled from Moncton to Winnipeg, a distance of $1940km$. On the return
trip, the planeâ€™s speed increased by $100km/h$ due to a tailwind. The total round trip took 6 hours. Find the average speed of the plane in each part of its journey, i.e. on the way to Winnipeg, and on the way back to Moncton.

let $t_{w} =$ time to Winnepeg, $t_{m} =$ time to Moncton ,  $s = speed$

a. Trip to Winnipeg

$$t_{w} \times s = 1940$$

$$t_{w} = \frac {1940}{s}$$

b. Trip to Moncton

$$t_{m} \times (s+100) = 1940$$

$$t_{m} = \frac {1940}{s+100}$$

building the quadratic

$$t_{w} + t_{m} = 6$$

$$\frac {1940}{s} + \frac {1940}{s+100} = 6$$

To solve for s we need to clear the fraction by multiplying every term by $s(s+ 100)$. (I had to get help with this part, I wasn't sure what to do. The next line was shown to me, but I did the rest of the work myself. I didn't know about multiplying everything by $s(s + 100)$ to get rid of the fractions. 

$$\frac {1940}{s} \times s(s + 100) + \frac {1940}{s+100} \times s(s+ 100) = 6 \times s(s + 100)$$

$$1940(s + 100) + 1940s = 6s(s + 100)$$

$$1940s + 194000 + 1940s = 6s^2 + 600s$$

$$3880s + 194000 = 6^2 + 600s$$

$$6s^2 + 600s = 3880s + 194000$$

$$6s^2 + 600s - 3880s - 194000 = 0$$

$$6s^2 - 3280s - 194000 = 0$$

Using the formula to solve for s:

$$s = \frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

$$s = \frac {-(-3280) \pm \sqrt{(-3280)^2-4(6)(-194000)}}{2(6)}$$

$$s = \frac {-(-3280) \pm \sqrt{10758400 +4656000}}{12}$$

$$s = \frac {-(-3280) \pm \sqrt{15414400}}{12}$$

$$s = \frac {-(-3280) \pm 3926.1176752614}{12}$$

Solving each:

Plus:

$$s = \frac {3280 + 3926.1176752614}{12}$$

$$s = \frac {7206.1176752614}{12}$$

$$s = 600.5098062718$$

Minus:

$$s = \frac {3280 - 3926.1176752614}{12}$$

$$s = \frac {646.1176752614}{12}$$

$$s = -53.8431396051$$


final:

$$s = 600.5, or -53.8$$

Because our speed is not going to be negative we know that the number we are looking for is $600.5$. Then with $1940/600.5+1940/700.5$ we get $6.0009$ we know that we got the right answer because this is $s$ and $s+100$. I would have rounded down to 600 and 700, but using the $.5$ value got me closer to $6$ hours, so I kept it.
