A few /kind of/ unrelated songs. 

Lately I've been tettering between feeling hopeless and optimistic. There are a few songs that have made me feel both sad and happy at the same time. 

###### Daniel Johnston - True Love Will Find You in the End

The pinned comment on Connor Price's video is a comment where he explains `Whatever you're pursuing, don't give up. You're always one day away from a life changing moment and you never know when that day will be. Keep going.`. This reminded me of the Daniel Johnston song where he says `True love will find you in the end, This is a promise with a catch, Only if you're looking can it find you, 'Cause true love is searching too, But how can it recognize you, If you don't step out into the light, the light`. 

I think both messages here are essentially the same. As long as we are searching for something, it's also searching for us. If we are searching for the abyss, the abyss is also searching for us; if we are searching for true love, true love is also searching for us. I've spent most of my adult life gazing into the abyss, waiting for something of value to gaze back at me. I don't think it works like that anymore. We can't just sit around waiting for things to happen, the action of inaction and being noncommital towards our goals and desires, can only lead to boredem and emptiness, that we will mostly fill with surface level entertainment and cheap experiences. 

If we want to deepen our experiences and find joy in things, we need to do the hard thing of not giving up, not giving in, and actually enjoying the pain that comes with discipline and commitment to our goals and desires.
