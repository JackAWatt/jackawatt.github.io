##### Final Velocity

* $v_f = v_i + a \times t$

* $v_f$ is the final velocity

* $v_i$ is the initial velocity

* $a$ is the acceleration due to gravity($9.8m/s^2$)

* $t$ is the time the object is in free fall

### For a stone dropped rest:

* $v_i = 9 m/s$ (initial velocity is zero because it is dropped, not thrown)

* $a = 9.8m/s^2$ (acceleration due to gravity)

* $t = 4.00s$(time it takes to hit the ground

* $v_f = 0 + 9.8 \times 4.00$

* $v_f = 39.2m/s$
