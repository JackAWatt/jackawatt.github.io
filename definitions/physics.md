#### Distance vs Displacement

* Distance involves magnitude
* Displacement involves magnitude and direction

* example: john travels 500 miles -- this is distance
* Example: mary travels 200 miles east --this is displacement

***

#### Scaler vs Vector

* distance is scaler
* a scaler has a magnitude only

* displacement is vector
* a vector has both a magnitude and direction

***

#### speed

d = vt

* Distance = speed * time - this is a scaler

* Distance = velocity * time - this is a vector

* Speed is always positive

* Velocity can be positive or negative

* Speed is the absolute value of velocity

#### acceeleration

if (a = +; v = +) || (a = -; v = -) then speed is increasing
if (a = +; v = -) || (a = -; v = +) then speed is decreasing

#### gravity

g = -9.8m/s^2 (earth)
g = -1.6m/s^2 (moon)

* gravity acts on the y axis, not the x axis.
* velocity can have an x and y component.

* velocity is the hypottenous of the the Vx Vy triangle

ay = g = -9.8


#### Significant Digits

* All non-zero digits are significant. For example, in the number 123.45, all digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are significant.

* Zeros between non-zero digits are significant. For example, in the number 5003, all four digits are significant.

* Leading zeros (zeros to the left of the first non-zero digit) are not significant. For example, in the number 0.0056, only the digits 5 and 6 are significant.

* Trailing zeros (zeros to the right of the last non-zero digit) are significant if there's a decimal point present. For example, in the number 120.0, all three digits are significant.

* Trailing zeros that merely serve as placeholders (without a decimal point) are not considered significant. For example, in the number 1200, only the digits 1 and 2 are significant.
