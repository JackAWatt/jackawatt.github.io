* Distance vs Displacement

Distance involves magnitude
Displacement involves magnitude and direction

example: john travels 500 miles -- this is distance
Example: mary travels 200 miles east --this is displacement

***

* Scaler vs Vector

distance is scaler
a scaler has a magnitude only

displacement is vector
a vector has both a magnitude and direction

***

* speed

d = vt

Distance = speed * time - this is a scaler

Distance = velocity * time - this is a vector

Speed is always positive

Velocity can be positive or negative

Speed is the absolute value of velocity
