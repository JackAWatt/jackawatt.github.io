#### Distance vs Displacement

* Distance involves magnitude
* Displacement involves magnitude and direction

* example: john travels 500 miles -- this is distance
* Example: mary travels 200 miles east --this is displacement

***

#### Scaler vs Vector

* distance is scaler
* a scaler has a magnitude only

* displacement is vector
* a vector has both a magnitude and direction

***

#### speed

d = vt

* Distance = speed * time - this is a scaler

* Distance = velocity * time - this is a vector

* Speed is always positive

* Velocity can be positive or negative

* Speed is the absolute value of velocity

#### acceeleration

if (a = +; v = +) || (a = -; v = -) then speed is increasing
if (a = +; v = -) || (a = -; v = +) then speed is decreasing

#### gravity

g = -9.8m/s^2 (earth)
g = -1.6m/s^2 (moon)

* gravity acts on the y axis, not the x axis.
* velocity can have an x and y component.

* velocity is the hypottenous of the the Vx Vy triangle
