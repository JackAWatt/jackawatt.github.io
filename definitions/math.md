# Word definitions and explanations
###### this is a living document, I'll be removing defitions when I feel like I've commited them to memory and don't need to look up what they mean anymore. 

## Math:

#### Geometry:
* What is the shape of a point?

In Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion upon which geometry is built. Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. In particular, the geometric points do not have length, area, volume, or any other dimensional attribute. A common point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space.

* Ray

In geometry, a "ray" is a part of a line that starts at a particular point and extends infinitely in one direction. It has one endpoint and goes on forever in one direction.

***

* Origin

In geometry, the term "origin" typically refers to a specific point in a coordinate system, often denoted as the point (0, 0). The coordinate system is a reference framework used to locate points in space. In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the origin is where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. The coordinates of the origin are (0, 0), and it serves as the starting point for measuring distances and locating other points.

In a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, there is also a z-axis, and the origin is the point where all three axes intersect. The coordinates of the three-dimensional origin are (0, 0, 0).

The choice of the origin is arbitrary, but once it is established, it provides a consistent reference point for describing the positions of other points in the coordinate system. Coordinates are typically given as ordered pairs (for two dimensions) or ordered triples (for three dimensions), indicating the distances along each axis from the origin to the point in question.

***

* Dialation

Dilations are a type of non-rigid transformation. They change the size of a shape by scaling it up or down, making it bigger or smaller. Unlike rigid transformations, dilations do not keep the shape's size the same.

***

* Translation

In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right. Translations only move things from one place to another; they don't change their size, arrangement, or direction.

***

* Rotation

In geometry, a rotation is a transformation that turns a figure or object around a fixed point known as the center of rotation. The object remains the same shape and size, but it is repositioned in space by a certain angle. The center of rotation is the point that stays fixed during the rotation, and the distance from any point on the object to the center of rotation remains constant.

Conventionally, positive angle measures describe counterclockwise rotations. If we want to describe a clockwise rotation, we use negative angle measures.

For example, here's the result of rotating a point about ‍P by -30

***

* Pre-images and Images

For any transformation, we have the pre-image figure, which is the figure we are performing the transformation upon, and the image figure, which is the result of the transformation. For example, if our rotation, the pre-image point was ‍A, then the image point would be A'. (A' is pronounced "A Prime")
 
***

* Reflection

In geometry, a reflection is a transformation that flips or mirrors a figure over a line, creating a mirror image. The line over which the reflection occurs is called the "line of reflection" or "mirror line." Each point on the original figure is equidistant from the line of reflection and its corresponding point on the reflected image.

***

* Theta

In mathematics, the symbol θ (theta) is often used to represent an angle in geometry and trigonometry. It's commonly used alongside other Greek letters such as α (alpha) and β (beta) to denote angles in mathematical equations, diagrams, and proofs.

Theta is also used in various mathematical contexts beyond geometry and trigonometry. For example, in complex analysis, it's frequently used to represent the polar angle of a complex number in the complex plane. In statistics, θ is often used to represent parameters of a statistical model or distribution.

The specific meaning of θ depends on the context in which it appears, but it generally signifies an angle or parameter in mathematical expressions.

***

* Oblique Triangle

An oblique triangle is a triangle that does not have a right angle. In other words, all of its interior angles are acute angles (less than 90 degrees). Unlike right triangles, which have one angle equal to 90 degrees, oblique triangles have all three angles less than 90 degrees.

***

* hypotenuse

The hypotenuse is a term used in geometry, specifically in right-angled triangles. It refers to the side of the triangle that is opposite the right angle. In other words, it's the longest side of the triangle and is the side that the other two sides (the legs) form the right angle with.

For any right triangle with legs of lengths a and b and hypotenuse of length c, the relationship between these sides is described by the Pythagorean theorem:

a²+b²=c²

This theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. It's a fundamental principle used in geometry and has applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and architecture.

* The Law of Sines:

- $\dfrac{\sin A}{a}=\dfrac{\sin B}{b}=\dfrac{\sin C}{c}$

***

* 6 trig functions:
* sin = opposite / hypotenuse
* cos = adjacent / hypotenuse
* tan = opposite / adjacent
* csc(cosecant) = reciprocal(sin)
* sec(secant) = reciprocal(cos)
* cot(cotangent) = reciprocal(tan)

***

* Vertex (Quadratic Equations)

In the context of quadratic equations, a vertex refers to the point on the graph of the quadratic function where the function reaches its maximum or minimum value. For a quadratic function in standard form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the vertex is given by the coordinates (- b/2a, 4ac-b^2/4a)

* If the coefficient of x2x2 term ( aa ) is positive, the parabola opens upwards and the vertex represents the minimum point on the graph.

*If the coefficient of x2x2 term ( aa ) is negative, the parabola opens downwards and the vertex represents the maximum point on the graph.

The vertex of a quadratic function is a critical point because it is where the function changes direction, transitioning from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa). It's also the point where the function attains its extreme value (maximum or minimum) within a given interval.

***

* Domain and Range

Domain is the set of all possible ***x*** values

Range is the set of all possible ***y*** values

***

* Axis of Symmetry

In the context of quadratic equations, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex of the parabola defined by the quadratic equation. For any quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, the axis of symmetry is given by the equation x = - b/2a​.

This means that the axis of symmetry is always perpendicular to the direction in which the parabola opens (upward or downward), and it divides the parabola into two symmetrical halves. The vertex, which lies on the axis of symmetry, is the highest or lowest point on the parabola, depending on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards.

***

* Second Differences

The second difference will always be constant for quadratics

* Changing a alters the curvature of the parabola and the direction it opens.
* Changing b alters the slope.
* Changing c moves the parabola up and down.
