# MIT-Challenge

* [modified from Scott H. Young's 12 month challange](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)
* I will complete 33 courses in 12 months
* to start I will work 8 hours monday-friday, and then 4 hours on weekends
* each course has an eleven day window to complete. 
* Some courses will be taken simultaniously
* Courses can be added, pushing the complete date back by 11 days.
* I am prepared for the reality that I will not be able to complete the 4 year curriculum in 12 months. 

# new components
* three non-mit classes(edx,coursera,udacity,etc)
* one of the great courses per 3 mit courses.

# How to prepare:
* prereqs for physics/calculus
* read on how to write a paper/theises
* read on how to do research
* practice math and programming
* be active. 
* read a lot

# courses:

* 8.01: Physics I-Classical Mechanics
* 18.01: Singel Variable Calculus
* 18.02:-multi-variable-calculus


# goals

* To be in the habbit of constantly having a lot on the go. 
* reach mathematical maturity
* have a foundational understanding of math, stats, cs, engineering, science. 
* enforce life long learning
* develop personality accountability
* to make this a long term goal. If I can complete 33 courses in 1 year, my next goal will be 100 completed courses. This will be done on a longer timescale. After 1 year of full time online courses I will need to get a full time job and continue on part time. 

I will start off optimisticly and will set a passing grade at 80% for theory, and all programs must be comprable to spec. I would rather finish late than rush through course material.

Some courses are prereq for many courses, I would like to add some of these in where possible.


# what I would get from an actual 4 year program
* access to labs, peers, support
