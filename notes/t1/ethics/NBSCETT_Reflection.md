The NBSCETT code of ethics serves as the foundation for professional conduct as a certified engineering technologist and certified technician. It's purpose is to maintain high standards in public safety and competency. 

Public safety is the primary goal of the Code of Ethics. Members are obligated to prioritize the safety of the public while doing their work. 

Competency is also very important, and is the mechanism through which Public Safety is maintained. Without a high requirement for competency it wouldn't be possible to prioritize public safety, because incompetent workers don't have the ability to determine what is and isn't safe. 

The use of the professional stamp is a significant legal responsibility given to the NBSCETT members. A member's stamp signifies that the work or document has been approved by a qualified professional. Using one's stamp in an area outside of one's proven area of expertise can lead to legal action from clients, employers, or regulaotory bodies.
