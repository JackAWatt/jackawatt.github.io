10 ^-3 -> miki

-6 -> micro, nano, pico, femto, atto

10^-3 = 1/10^3


1 coloumb = 6.....

Formula ==

Q = (# of electrons) / (6.24 * 10^18 electrons/coulomb)

I = Q/t

1A = 1c/sec

voltage accross

currrent through

current ia from negative to positive in actuality, but for engieering we think from positive to negative

I = V / R

voltage = pressue
