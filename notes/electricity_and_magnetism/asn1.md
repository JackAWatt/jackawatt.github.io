# 1. Perform the following conversions:

* a. **2000 us to milliseconds**

$$2000us * 1m / 1000u = 2m$$

* b. **0.04 ms to microseconds**

$$0.04ms * 1000u / 1m = 40us$$

* c. **0.06 uF to nanofarads**

$$0.06uF * 1000n / 1u = 60nF$$

* d. **8400 ps to microseconds**

$$8400ps / 10^{|-12-(-6)|} = 0.0084ms$$

* e. **0.006 km to millimeters**

$$0.006km * 10^{|3-(-3)|} =  6000mm$$

* f. **260 x 10^3 mm to kilometers**

$$260 * 10^3 mm * 10^{|-3-3|} = 0.26 km$$

2. **If 312 C of charge pass through a wire in 2 min, find the current in amperes.**

$$\frac {312 c}{2 * 60 s} = 2.6A$$

The current is 2.6 A

3. **If 21.847 x10^18 electrons pass through a wire in 7 s, find the current.**

$$Q = 21.847 * 10^18 / 6.24 * 10^18$$

$$Q = 3.5011217949$$

$$I = \frac{Q}{t}$$

$$I = \frac{ 3.5011217949}{7}$$

$$I = 0.5001602564 A$$

$$I = 500.1602564 mA$$

The current is 500.1602564 mA

4. **How many electrons pass through a conductor in 5 minutes and 30s if the current is 4mA?**

$$I = Q/t$$

$$Q = I/t$$

$$Q = 4mA * (5*60+30)$$

$$Q = 4 * 10^-3 A * (5*60+30)$$

$$Q = 1.32c$$

$$N = c / 1.602 * 10^-{19}$$

$$N = 1.32 c / 1.602 * 10^-{19}$$

$$N = 8239700374531840000$$

$$N = 8.23970037453184 * 10^{18}$$

The number of electrons that pass through a conductor in 5 minutes and 30s if the current is 4mA is $8.23970037453184 * 10^{18}$

5. **Will a fuse rated at 1 A “blow” if 86 C pass through it in 1.2 min?**

$$I = Q/t$$

$$I = \frac {86\ c}{1.2*60\ s}$$

$$I = 1.19\overline{4}\ A$$

The current is greater than the rating of the fuse, therefore it will blow

6. **What current will a battery with an Ah rating of 180 theoretically provide for 40 h?**

$$I = \frac {Ah}{h}$$

$$I = \frac {180\ Ah}{40\ h}$$

$$I = 4.5\ A$$

The current will theoretically be 4.5 A for a battery with an Ah rating of 180 Ah for 40 h

7. **What is the Ah rating of a battery that can provide 0.8 A for 75 h?**

$$I = \frac {Ah}{h}$$

$$0.8\ A = \frac {Ah}{75\ h}$$

$$0.8\ A * 75 = \frac {Ah}{75\ h} * 75$$


$$60\ h = Ah$$

$$Ah = 60\ Ah$$

The Ah rating of a battery that can provide 0.8 A for 75 h is 60 Ah

8. **For how many hours will a battery with an Ah rating of 80 theoretically provide a current of 1.28 A**

$$I = \frac {Ah}{h}$$


$$1.28\ A = \frac {80\ Ah}{h}$$

$$h = \frac {80\ Ah}{1.28\ A}$$

$$h = 62.5\ h$$

The batttery with an Ah rating of 80 will theoretically provide a current of 1.28 A for 62.5 h
