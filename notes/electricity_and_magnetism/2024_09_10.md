aluminum overheats

conductors need to be insultated (ceremaic or plasstic) - no current

voltage must block voltage

semiconductor - can conduct or block - can on/off 1/0

semiconductor - 4 in valence

volt meter high resistence - 

amp meter short circuit

open = no i, r = $\inf$

closed = max I, res = 0 ohm

open = off

closed = on

$$5\ milliA + 6\ micoA = $$

$$220\ ohms + 1.42\ kOhms = 1.42 kOhms$$
