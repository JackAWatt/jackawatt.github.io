* and - for inputs of a(1) and b(1) the output is 1, and for all other inputs the output is 0.

* or - for inputs of a(0) and b(0) the output is 0, and for all other inputs the output is 1.

* not - for input is flipped. input of a(1) results in output of 0, and input of a(0) results in output of 1.

* nor - for inputs of a(0) and b(0) the output is 1. for all other inputs the output is 0.

* xor - if only one input is 1, then the output is 1. For all other inputs the output is 0.

* xnor - for inputs where a not equal b, the output is 1. for inputs where a equal b, the output is 0.

* nand - for inputs of a(1) and b(1) the output is 0. For all other inputs the output is 1
