A hot air balloon works because hot air is less dense than cool air. By heating the air up inside the balloon, it's about to rise in the air. By letting the balloon cool, the balloon--and basket--will sink. The hot air balloon operator can heat the air up when they want to move the balloon upwards, and let it cool down when they want to move downwards. This phenomenon is called buoyancy. To steer the hot air balloon, the operator would catch air currents at different heights.

Hydraulics work through the a system that involves two pistons (per hydraulic cylinder) with a fluid in between. The hydraulic cylinder converts the energy applied into mechanical energy. The science is hydraulics is derived from pascal's principle, which states "that pressure is equal to the force divided by the area on which it acts". In a hydraulic system a small cylinder will be connected to a larger cylinder, allowing the transfer of energy from the small cylinder to the large cylinder. Hydraulics can be both closed and open systems. The open-loop hydraulic systems draw and return their fluid to an open reservoir allowing for cooling, filtering, and replenishment. They hydraulics used in car or bike suspension would be closed-loop, and the hydraulics in some large industrial or mechanical machinery might be open-loop.

Pneumatic systems use compressed air or gas to transmit force. The movement of air or gas occurs by opening a valve, which releases the air or gas from a reservoir. This release creates pressure that moves an actuator to do work. Actuators might be of different weights which would allow for applying a specific force when the gas or air is released. To compress the air, the system typically would use a compressor to pressurize the air or gas, the more tightly packed the molecules of air or gas are, the more potential energy they have that can be converted to kinetic energy. 

In a pneumatic system that uses air, typically air will be vented to the atmosphere after the compressed air has done its work--this would be an open system. In a system that uses a specialized gas, then that gas would be recompressed.

This is specific heat. Water and sand both have different specific heats, meaning that they heat up and cool down at different rates. Water can absorb a lot of heat while only raising its temperature slightly. 

Sensible heat is also involved here because the heat absorbed by the water and sand increases their temperature without causing a phase change is sensible heat. 

This is not latent heat, because there is no phase change.
