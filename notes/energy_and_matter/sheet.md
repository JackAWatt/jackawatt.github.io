### Formula for Power Required by the Pump:

\[
P = \frac{\rho \cdot g \cdot Q \cdot h}{1000}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = Power in kilowatts (kW)
- \( \rho \) = Density of water in kg/m³ (typically 1000 kg/m³)
- \( g \) = Gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- \( Q \) = Volumetric flow rate in m³/s
- \( h \) = Height the water is lifted in meters

### Steps:
1. **Density of water** \( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) is the standard value at normal temperature and pressure.
   
2. **Volumetric flow rate** \( Q \):
   - Convert the flow rate from liters per minute to cubic meters per second.
   - \( 1500 \, \text{L/min} = 1.5 \, \text{m}^3/\text{min} \).
   - To convert minutes to seconds, divide by 60:  
   \[
   Q = \frac{1.5}{60} = 0.025 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}
   \]

3. **Height** \( h
