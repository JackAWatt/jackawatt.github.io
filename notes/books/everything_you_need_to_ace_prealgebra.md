# Chapter 1: Types of Numbers

Real Numbers: Real Numbers include all Rational and Irational numbers. 
- Rational: -n/n (can't have 0 in teh denominator)
- - Integers: -n..+n
- - - Whole: 0..n
- - - - Natural: 1..n
- Irratonal: Numbers that can't be represented by dividing an integer by another integer. Any irrational number written as a decimal goes on forever. 

Examples:

-2 is an integer, rational number, and real number.
7/11 is a rational and real number

# Chapter 2: Algebraic Properties

###### The commutative property of addition and multiplcation: the order of opperands in an addition or multiplitation does not matter. A+B=B+A ; A\*B=B\*A

###### The commutative property doesn't work with subtraction or division: A-B != B-A
- 7-1 = 6
- 1-7 = -6
- 5 / 2 = 2.5
- 2 / 5 = 0.4

###### The associative property of addition and multiplication states that for any three numbers a,b and c: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). 
1+(2+3) = 6
3+(1+2) = 6
3*(1*6) = 18
1*(3*6) = 18

Commutative relates to the order of the numbers

Associative relates to the grouping of the numbers

###### The distributive property of multiplaction over addition: a * b + a * c = a(b+c)

4(5+7) = 48
20+28 = 48
4*5+4*7=48

###### The distributive property of multiplaction over subtraction: a - b + a - c = a(b-c)

3(12-6) = 18
3*12-3*6= 18
