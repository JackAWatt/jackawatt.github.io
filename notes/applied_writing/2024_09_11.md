An **independent clause** is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate (verb) and expresses a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence.

Example:  
- **"She went to the store."**  
  - This sentence has a subject ("She") and a verb ("went") and expresses a complete thought.

A **dependent clause** (also known as a subordinate clause) is a group of words that also contains a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence and needs to be connected to an independent clause.

Example:  
- **"Because she was hungry,"**  
  - This clause has a subject ("she") and a verb ("was"), but it does not express a complete thought on its own. It leaves the reader wondering, "What happened because she was hungry?" It needs to be connected to an independent clause to form a complete sentence, like this:
  - **"Because she was hungry, she went to the store."**  

Here, "Because she was hungry" is the dependent clause, and "she went to the store" is the independent clause. Together, they form a complete sentence.
