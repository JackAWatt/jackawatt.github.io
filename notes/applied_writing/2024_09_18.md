**Parallelism** in writing refers to the use of similar grammatical structures or patterns in a series of words, phrases, or clauses. It creates balance and clarity, making sentences easier to read and understand. Correct parallelism means that items in a series should match in terms of structure.

### Examples of Correct Parallelism:

1. **Words or phrases:**
   - Incorrect: She likes **reading**, **to swim**, and **hiking**.
   - Correct: She likes **reading**, **swimming**, and **hiking**.
   
2. **Clauses:**
   - Incorrect: He wanted **to study**, **to sleep**, and **watching TV**.
   - Correct: He wanted **to study**, **to sleep**, and **to watch TV**.

3. **Lists:**
   - Incorrect: The job requires **attention to detail**, **problem-solving**, and **that you work long hours**.
   - Correct: The job requires **attention to detail**, **problem-solving**, and **the ability to work long hours**.

### Why Use Parallelism?
- It improves readability and flow.
- It adds rhythm and balance.
- It enhances clarity and coherence.

To ensure parallelism, keep all elements in a list or series consistent in form (noun with noun, verb with verb, etc.).
