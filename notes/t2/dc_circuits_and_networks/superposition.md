replace V sources that are off with a short circuit

replace I souces that are off with an open circuit


super position:

* 1 turn off source

* 2 turn off other source

* 3 add results


* current to voltage requies i source in parallell with a resistor
* v to c requires v souce in series with resistor

# thevenin

* remove something
* Eth =
* Rth =
* addRl back in
* go back
