#### a:

**Lines CD, and EF are parallell to line AB**

---

#### b:

**Lines HG and LK and perpindicular to line AB**

---

#### What is the masure of angle theta?

* AB ⊥ HG ∴ ∠θ=90∘

* ∠EBC = 90∘ - given

* ∠CBD = 58∘ - Given

* ∠ABE is suplementary to ∠EBC ∴ ∠ABE = 90∘

* ∠EBD is complementary to ∠CBD ∴ ∠EBD = 32∘

* ∠AB is ∠ABE + ∠EBC ∴ ∠AB = 180∘

* NOTE: One line wasn't named, so I named it E

* ∠COE = 46∘ - given
* ∠EOD = 90∘ - given
* ∠BOD = 180∘ -(∠COE + ∠EOD) because CB is a straight line. 
* ∠BOD = 44∘

* ∠1 = ∠2 - given
* ∠1 = 180∘ - 151∘ because the ∠151∘ is supplementary to ∠1
* ∠1 = 29∘
* ∠2 = ∠1 = 29∘
* ∠4 is vertical to ∠2 ∴ ∠4 = 29∘

$$\frac {500\ m}{540\ m} = \frac {860\ m}{x}$$

$$x = \frac {540}{500} * 860$$

$$x = 928.8$$

$$x = 929\ m$$

**The distance on 1st street between street B and street C is 929 M**

* ∠B = 50∘ - given
* ∠ABC + ∠B is a straight line ∴ ∠ABC = 130∘
* ∠ABC is alternate exterior to ∠BCD ∴ ∠BCD = ∠ABC
* ∠BCD = 130∘

**The measure of the angle between BC and CD is 130∘**
