**Quadratic**

$$x = \frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}$$

**vertex**

$$h = -\frac {b}{2a}$$

$$k = a(h)^2+b(h) + c$$

**y-intercept = set x to 0**

# Using log base 10 to find natural log

$$log_{10}(x)*ln(10)$$

# ln and e

* y and z are known values, x is unknown
 
$$z\ ln(x) = y$$

$$ln(x) = \frac {y}{z}$$

$$x = e^{\frac {y}{z}}$$

# log with unknown exponents

* y and z are known values, x is unknown

$$y^x = z$$

$$ln(y^x) = ln(z)$$

$$x\ ln(y) = ln(z)$$

$$x = \frac {ln(z)}{ln(y)}$$


# log with variables

* x is unknown, y, n, and z are known

$$log_y(x-z) = n$$

$$y^n = x-z$$

# Arc

* note: degrees need to be converted to radians

* Area of a sector

$$A = \frac {1}{2} r^2 \theta$$

* area based on a sector

$$A = A_{sector}*N_{sectors}$$

* d and r based on A

$$A = \pi r^2$$

* area baased on sector of a circle when angle in degrees

$$A = \frac {\theta}{360} * \pi * r^2$$

* i = i_m sin(theta) where i_m is the max current, find i if i_m = x and theta = y

* convert deg to rad and subtract 360 until deg < 360. 

$$i = i_m * sin(\theta)$$
