# Using log base 10 to find natural log

$$log_{10}(x)*ln(10)$$

# ln and e

* y and z are known values, x is unknown
 
$$z\ ln(x) = y$$

$$ln(x) = \frac {y}{z}$$

$$x = e^{\frac {y}{z}}$$

# log with unknown exponents

* y and z are known values, x is unknown

$$y^x = z$$

$$ln(y^x) = ln(z)$$

$$x\ ln(y) = ln(z)$$

$$x = \frac {ln(z)}{ln(y)}$$


# log with variables

* x is unknown, y, n, and z are known

$$log_y(x-z) = n$$

$$y^n = x-z$$
