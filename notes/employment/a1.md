My background before taking this course is in computer science and information security. With my newly acquired skills in electronics engineering technology, there are varous services I could offer. 

I could offer a service where I test the security of a small business, and then propose solutions to remediate any vulnerabilities to lessen the potential attack surface. Part of this service could be to train employees of small businesses to be more security minded as a way to ensure they aren't accidently exposing themselves or the business to unnesecary risk. 

With my newly acquired skills from this course, I'm almost ready to start offering assessments of electronic devices to ensure they aren't easily exploited. This would be done through methods such as obfuscating binaries, making sure there isn't a UART or JTAG exposed or through ensuring that there aren't non-destructive means to dump the firmware.
