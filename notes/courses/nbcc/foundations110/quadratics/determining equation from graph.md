We can use what we know about the factored form to determine the equation of a quadratic function using certain information about the parabola.  We might start with the graph, or information about the graph.  In order to set up an equation in factored form, we need to know the x-intercepts (this gives us “r” and “s”) and another point on the parabola (this gives us an ordered pair of (x, y) values).  This information will allow us to find the value of “a”.  This is what we need in order to write the full equation.

By inspection we see a point (4, -4), which happens to be the vertex in this case.  In addition, the x-intercepts give us r = 2 and s = 6.  Therefore, we can substitute what we know into the factored form:

$$y = a(x -r)(x - s)$$

$$-4 = a(4 - 2)(4 - 6)$$

$$-4 = a(2)(-2)$$

$$-4 = -4a$$

$$\frac {-4}{-4} = a$$

$$a = 1$$

Therefore, we can write the equation of the parabola:

$$y = (x -2)(x - 6)$$

or, we can expand to get this in standard form:

$$y = x^2 -6x -2x + 12$$

$$y = x^2 -8x + 12$$
