*     classify matter according to its composition (elements, compounds, pure substances or mixtures).
*     define and distinguish between chemical and physical properties.
*     apply the periodic law, as illustrated by the periodic table, to identify and distinguish various categories of elements (metals, nonmetals, periods, groups, s-p-d-f blocks and representative and transition elements).
*     predict ionic charges from an element's position on the periodic table.
*     provide definitions and examples of atoms, ions and molecules, including subatomic particles, atomic mass, atomic number, mass number, valence electrons and isotopes.
*     explain the factors that contribute to the unique position of hydrogen on the periodic table.
*     identify the elements that are most prevalent in living systems.
*     research chemical additives in consumer products and investigate the claims made by companies about the products.
*     differentiate between atomic number, mass number and atomic mass; explain the relative nature of atomic mass.
*     explain isotopes and calculate for weighted atomic masses; explain valence electrons and ions.
*     discuss the inadequacies in the Rutherford and Bohr atomic models; summarize the evolution of the modern day quantum mechanical model.
*     describe the energies and positions of electrons and the shapes of various orbital levels, according to the quantum mechanical model.
*     recognize and produce electron configuration diagrams using the Aufbau principle, Pauli's exclusion principle and Hund's rule.
