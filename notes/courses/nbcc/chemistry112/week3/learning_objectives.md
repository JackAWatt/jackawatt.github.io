*    explain the formation of various categories of bonds; define and differentiate between ionic and covalent (or molecular) compounds, including acids and bases.
*    investigate covalent network solids with reference to the allotropes of carbon (diamond, graphite, fullerenes, Bucky ball and nanotubes).
*    identify, name and write formulas for a wide array of compounds, using IUPAC and classical systems.
*    link the importance of the octet rule, valence electrons, electronegativity and polarity to bond formation.
*    sketch and interpret structural diagrams, Lewis dot structures and VSEPR geometries for many compounds.
*    outline and explain types of intermolecular forces between molecules in a substance.
*    explain and classify the properties of ionic, covalent, metallic and covalent network substances with specific references to their chemical bonds.
*    illustrate how chemical bonding theory can explain natural (or synthetic) phenomena and be applied to the development of new technologies.
