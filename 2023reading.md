# Larger List
## [books rated 5 stars by random person on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee):

* [Matter and Memory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/865540.Matter_and_Memory)

> One of the major works of an important modern philosopher, Matter & Memory investigates the autonomous yet interconnected planes formed by matter & perception on the one hand & memory & time on the other. Henry Bergson (1859-1941) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1927. His works include Time & Free Will, An Introduction to Metaphysics, Creative Evolution & The Creative Mind.

* [Mathematics for the Nonmathematician](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/281821.Mathematics_for_the_Nonmathematician)

> Practical, scientific, philosophical, and artistic problems have caused men to investigate mathematics. But there is one other motive which is as strong as any of these — the search for beauty. Mathematics is an art, and as such affords the pleasures which all the arts afford." In this erudite, entertaining college-level text, Morris Kline, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at New York University, provides the liberal arts student with a detailed treatment of mathematics in a cultural and historical context. 

* [On Dialogue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204526.On_Dialogue)

> Never before has there been a greater need for deeper listening and more open communication to cope with the complex problems facing our organizations, businesses and societies. Renowned scientist David Bohm believed there was a better way for humanity to discover meaning and to achieve harmony. He identified creative dialogue, a sharing of assumptions and understanding, as a means by which the individual, and society as a whole, can learn more about themselves and others, and achieve a renewed sense of purpose.

* [Thinking in Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)

> Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.

* [Nietzsche and Philosophy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1058397.Nietzsche_and_Philosophy)

> A landmark, Nietzsche and Philosophy is one of the first books to dispute the deep-seated assumption that dialectics provide the only possible basis for radical thought. Deleuze's analysis stands at the beginning of an important avenue of postwar thought - poststructuralism. For this first English translation, Gilles Deleuze has written a new introduction.

* [Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13187377-less-than-nothing)

> For the last two centuries, Western philosophy has developed in the shadow of Hegel, an influence each new thinker struggles to escape. As a consequence, Hegel’s absolute idealism has become the bogeyman of philosophy, obscuring the fact that he is the defining philosopher of the historical transition to modernity, a period with which our own times share startling similarities.

* [The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455992.The_Alphabet_Versus_the_Goddess)

> This groundbreaking book proposes that the rise of alphabetic literacy reconfigured the human brain and brought about profound changes in history, religion, and gender relations. Making remarkable connections across brain function, myth, and anthropology, Dr. Shlain shows why pre-literate cultures were principally informed by holistic, right-brain modes that venerated the Goddess, images, and feminine values. Writing drove cultures toward linear left-brain thinking and this shift upset the balance between men and women, initiating the decline of the feminine and ushering in patriarchal rule. Examining the cultures of the Israelites, Greeks, Christians, and Muslims, Shlain reinterprets ancient myths and parables in light of his theory. Provocative and inspiring, this book is a paradigm-shattering work that will transform your view of history and the mind.

* [Truth and Method](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213142.Truth_and_Method)

> Written in the 1960s, Truth and Method is Gadamer's magnum opus. An astonishing synthesis of literary criticism, philosophy, theology, the theory of law and classical scholarship, it is undoubtedly one of the most important texts in twentieth century philosophy. Looking behind the self-consciousness of science, he discusses the tense relationship between truth and methodology. In examining the different experiences of truth, he aims to "present the hermeneutic phenomenon in its fullest extent."

* [Fear Reverence Terror](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31939470-fear-reverence-terror#SocialReviews)

> Fear, Reverence, Terror invites us to look at images slowly, with the help of a few examples: Picasso’s Guernica, the “Lord Kitchener Wants You” World War I recruitment poster, Jacques-Louis David’s Marat, the frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan, a cup of gilded silver with scenes from the conquest of the New World. Are these political images, Carlo Ginzburg asks? Yes, because every image is, in a sense, political—an instrument of power. Tacitus once wrote, unforgettably, that we are enslaved by lies of which we ourselves are the authors. Is it possible to break this bond? Fear, Reverence, Terror will answer this question.

* [The Origin of Philosophy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/403400.The_Origin_of_Philosophy)

> Ortega deals here with the roots and historical justification of philosophy, and the question of philosophy's essential unity.

* [Learning to Learn and the Navigation of Moods: The Meta-Skill for the Acquisition of Skills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33572234-learning-to-learn-and-the-navigation-of-moods)

> One of the most important skills we need to develop for ourselves and for our children is the skill of learning to learn. But what is this skill? How do we learn to learn? What gets in our way? The author explores these questions and claims that learning to learn requires that we learn to navigate the moods that we routinely fall into during the learning process. 

* [Against Method](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137979.Against_Method)

> Modern philosophy of science has paid great attention to the understanding of scientific "practice, " in contrast to the earlier concentration on scientific "method." Paul Feyerabend's acclaimed work, which has contributed greatly to this new emphasis, shows the deficiencies of some widespread ideas about the nature of knowledge. He argues that the only feasible explanations of scientific successes are historical explanations, and that anarchism must now replace rationalism in the theory of knowledge.

* [Synthetic Philosophy of Contemporary Mathematics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13628359-synthetic-philosophy-of-contemporary-mathematics)

> A panoramic survey of the vast spectrum of modern and contemporary mathematics and the new philosophical possibilities they suggest, this book gives the inquisitive non-specialist an insight into the conceptual transformations and intellectual orientations of modern and contemporary mathematics.

* [After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199850.After_Finitude)

> The exceptional lucidity and the centrality of argument in Meillassoux's writing should appeal to analytic as well as continental philosophers, while his critique of fideism will be of interest to anyone preoccupied by the relation between philosophy, theology and religion. Meillassoux introduces a startlingly novel philosophical alternative to the forced choice between dogmatism and critique. After Finitude proposes a new alliance between philosophy and science and calls for an unequivocal halt to the creeping return of religiosity in contemporary philosophical discourse.

* [Deleuze, The Dark Precursor: Dialectic, Structure, Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14946299-deleuze-the-dark-precursor)

> A thoughtful and original analysis of the writings of influential French philosopher Gilles Deleuze

* [Simulacra and Simulation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22613.Simulacra_and_Simulation)

> Baudrillard uses the concepts of the simulacra—the copy without an original—and simulation. These terms are crucial to an understanding of the postmodern, to the extent that they address the concept of mass reproduction and reproduceability that characterizes our electronic media culture.

* [The Timeless Way of Building](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building)

> He writes, “There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.”


* [Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337517.Things_Hidden_Since_the_Foundation_of_the_World)

> This is the single fullest summation of Girard's ideas to date(1978), the book by which they will stand or fall. In a dialogue with two psychiatrists (Jean-Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort), Girard probes an encyclopedic array of topics, ranging across the entire spectrum of anthropology, psychoanalysis, and cultural production.

* [Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2409399.Nietzsche_and_the_Vicious_Circle)

> Taking a structuralist approach to the relation between Nietzsche's thought and his life, Klossowski emphasizes the centrality of the notion of Eternal Return (a cyclical notion of time and history) for understanding Nietzsche's propensities for self-denial, self-reputation, and self-consumption.

* [Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals)

> Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.

* [Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6763725-capitalist-realism)

> After 1989, capitalism has presented itself as the only realistic political-economic system. What effects has this “capitalist realism” had on work, culture, education and mental health? Is it possible to imagine an alternative to capitalism that is not some throwback to discredited models of state control?

* [How the Laws of Physics Lie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/288715.How_the_Laws_of_Physics_Lie)

> In this sequence of philosophical essays about natural science, Nancy Cartwright argues that fundamental explanatory laws, the deepest and most admired successes of modern physics, do not in fact describe the regularities that exist in nature.

* [The Denial of Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8135626-the-denial-of-death)

> Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the "why" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.

* [The Listening Society: A Metamodern Guide to Politics, Book One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> As we move from the industrial age and its nation state to an internet age with a globalized postindustrial market a question presents itself: What is the next major developmental stage of society after the liberal democracy with a balance between capitalism and welfare state?

* [The Ponzi Factor: The Simple Truth About Investment Profits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38728046-the-ponzi-factor)

> The Ponzi Factor is the most comprehensive research ever compiled on the negative-sum nature of capital gains (non-dividend stocks). The book shows why, as a whole, ALL investors will lose money from buying and selling stocks.

* [Set The Night On Fire: L.A. in the Sixties](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7863.Set_The_Night_On_Fire)

> Histories of the US Sixties invariably focus on New York City, but Los Angeles was an epicenter of that decade's political and social earthquake. LA was a launchpad for Black Power--where Malcolm X and Angela Davis first came to prominence and the Watts uprising shook the nation--and home to the Chicano walkouts and Moratorium, as well as birthplace of "Asian America" as a political identity, base of the antiwar movement, and of course, center of California counterculture.

* [Transformative Experience](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22329084-transformative-experience)

> Using classic philosophical examples about the nature of consciousness, and drawing on recent work in normative decision theory, cognitive science, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind, Paul develops a rigorous account of transformative experience that sheds light on how we should understand real-world experience and our capacity to rationally map our subjective futures.

* [The Ecology of Others]()

> The Ecology of Others presents a compelling challenge to anthropologists, ecologists, and environmental studies scholars to rethink the way we conceive of humans, objects, and the environment. Thought-provoking and engagingly written, it will be required reading for all those interested in moving beyond the moving beyond the confines of this fascinating debate

* [The Brain that Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/570172.The_Brain_that_Changes_Itself)

> An astonishing new science called neuroplasticity is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they’ve transformed - people whose mental limitations or brain damage were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. 

* [Your Inner Fish: a Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1662160.Your_Inner_Fish)

> Why do we look the way we do? What does the human hand have in common with the wing of a fly? Are breasts, sweat glands, and scales connected in some way? To better understand the inner workings of our bodies and to trace the origins of many of today's most common diseases, we have to turn to unexpected sources: worms, flies, and even fish.

* [Why Evolution Is True](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4005310-why-evolution-is-true)

> Why Evolution Is True weaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, and anatomy that demonstrate the "indelible stamp" of the processes first proposed by Darwin. In crisp, lucid prose accessible to a wide audience, Why Evolution Is True dispels common misunderstandings and fears about evolution and clearly confirms that this amazing process of change has been firmly established as a scientific truth.

* [Failure: Why Science Is so Successful](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25972391-failure)

> In his sequel to Ignorance (Oxford University Press, 2012), Stuart Firestein shows us that the scientific enterprise is riddled with mistakes and errors - and that this is a good thing! Failure: Why Science Is So Successful delves into the origins of scientific research as a process that relies upon trial and error, one which inevitably results in a hefty dose of failure.

* [The Joy of Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58885956-the-joy-of-science)

> Today's world is unpredictable and full of contradictions, and navigating its complexities while trying to make the best decisions is far from easy. The Joy of Science presents 8 short lessons on how to unlock the clarity, empowerment, and joy of thinking and living a little more scientifically.

* [Horizons: The Global Origins of Modern Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56246458-horizons)

> Horizons is the history of science as it has never been told before, uncovering its unsung heroes and revealing that the most important scientific breakthroughs have come from the exchange of ideas from different cultures around the world. In this ambitious and revisionist history, James Poskett recasts the history of science, uncovering the vital contributions that scientists in Africa, America, Asia, and the Pacific have made to this global story.

* [Psychology Gone Wrong: The Dark Sides of Science and Therapy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24858363-psychology-gone-wrong)

> This is the first book which comprehensively covers all mistakes, frauds and abuses of academic psychology, psychotherapy, and psycho-business.

* [The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54616040-the-constitution-of-knowledge)

> Arming Americans to defend the truth from today's war on facts

Disinformation. Trolling. Conspiracies. Social media pile-ons. Campus intolerance. On the surface, these recent additions to our daily vocabulary appear to have little in common. But together, they are driving an epistemic crisis: a multi-front challenge to America's ability to distinguish fact from fiction and elevate truth above falsehood.

* [Do The Right Thing: Studies In Limited Rationality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3940275-do-the-right-thing)

>  In Do the Right Thing, the authors argue that a new theoretical foundation for artificial intelligence can be constructed in which rationality is a property of programs within a finite architecture, and their behaviour over time in the task environment, rather than a property of individual decisions.

* [The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/700096.The_Robot_s_Rebellion)

> The idea that we might be robots is no longer the stuff of science fiction; decades of research in evolutionary biology and cognitive science have led many esteemed scientists to the conclusion that, according to the precepts of universal Darwinism, humans are merely the hosts for two replicators (genes and memes) that have no interest in us except as conduits for replication. Richard Dawkins, for example, jolted us into realizing that we are just survival mechanisms for our own genes, sophisticated robots in service of huge colonies of replicators to whom concepts of rationality, intelligence, agency, and even the human soul are irrelevant.

* [Where Mathematics Come From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53337.Where_Mathematics_Come_From)

> This book is about mathematical ideas, about what mathematics means-and why. Abstract ideas, for the most part, arise via conceptual metaphor-metaphorical ideas projecting from the way we function in the everyday physical world. Where Mathematics Comes From argues that conceptual metaphor plays a central role in mathematical ideas within the cognitive unconscious-from arithmetic and algebra to sets and logic to infinity in all of its forms.

For the first time, Rose takes us beyond the battlefront and into the shadowy underworld of double agents and triple crosses, covert operations and code breaking, and unmasks the courageous, flawed individuals who inhabited this wilderness of mirrors—including the spymaster at the heart of it all, George Washington.

* [Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27918336-vanguard-of-the-imam)

> Iran's Revolutionary Guards are one of the most important forces in the Middle East today. As the appointed defender of Iran's revolution, the Guards have evolved into a pillar of the Islamic Republic and the spearhead of its influence. Their sway has spread across the Middle East, where the Guards have overseen loyalist support to Bashar al-Assad in Syria and been a staunch backer in Iraq's war against ISIS-bringing its own troops, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and Shiite militias to the fight. Links to terrorism, human rights abuses, and the suppression of popular democracy have shrouded the Revolutionary Guards in controversy. 

* [The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2794230-the-devil-we-know)

> ROBERT B. BAER is one of the most accomplished agents in CIA history, and a winner of the Career Intelligence Medal.
