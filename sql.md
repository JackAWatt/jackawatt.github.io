* My suggestion is to start with the first link(SQL Challenges on HackerRank). 
* If you need a refresher on SQL then check out Learn SQL under learning platforms. It's interactive and everything can be completed in the browser
* The book Learn SQL the hard way is also a good starting point, and will be the most in depth option, but it requires installing sqlite on your machine

#### Challenges

* [SQL Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) - HackerRank

#### Learning Platforms

* [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-sql) - CodeCademy

#### full book:

* [Learn SQL the Hard Way](https://github.com/taboularasa/learn_sql_the_hard_way/blob/master/learn-sql-the-hard-way.pdf) - this is a good resource, I've completed learn ruby the hard way and learn python the hard way. Don't be fooled by "hard" though, the style here is very accessible.
