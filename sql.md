My suggestion is to start with the first link(SQL Challenges on HackerRank). Get as far as you can and then depending on if you prefer video or a book, pick an option below. 

#### Challenges

* [SQL Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) - HackerRank
* [PL/SQL](https://exercism.org/tracks/plsql)

#### Videos with included projects

* [SQL for beginners](https://youtu.be/Rm0xH2Vpfi0) - This has videos to follow, including how to set up MySQL on windows, as well as a database to import. Files are [here](https://codebasics.io/resources/sql-tutorials-for-beginners)
* [SQL Beginner to Advanced For Data Professionals](https://codebasics.io/courses/sql-beginner-to-advanced-for-data-professionals) - This one is 15$ USD, in case you liked the first course. I haven't taken it, but it's highly rated

#### full book:

* [Learn SQL the Hard Way](https://github.com/taboularasa/learn_sql_the_hard_way/blob/master/learn-sql-the-hard-way.pdf) - this is a good resource, I've completed learn ruby the hard way and learn python the hard way. Don't be fooled by "hard" though, the style here is very accessible
