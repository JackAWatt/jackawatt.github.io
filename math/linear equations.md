# Systems of linear equations

Rules: 

each variable is raised to the first power
1 variable or is a constant.

generic term: ax + by = c

SI form = y = mx + b

* 19:

-5

* 27:

y = 2 -1

* 43

$$24x + 40y = 15$$

$$24x - 24x + 40y = -24x 15$$

$$40y = -24x + 15$$

$$\frac {40y}{40} = \frac {-24x}{40} + \frac{15}{40}$$


$$ y = \frac {-24x}{40} + \frac{15}{40}$$

$$ y = \frac {-3x}{5} + \frac {3}{8}$$
