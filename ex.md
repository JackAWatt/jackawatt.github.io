The choice between learning complex analysis before real analysis or vice versa depends on your goals, mathematical background, and interests. Here are some factors to consider:

**Learning Complex Analysis Before Real Analysis**:

1. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Complex analysis typically assumes a foundation in calculus, including multivariable calculus and basic real analysis. If you already have a solid understanding of calculus and want to explore a new area of mathematics, starting with complex analysis might be a viable option.

2. **Interest in Complex Numbers**: If you are particularly intrigued by complex numbers and their properties, complex analysis is the natural choice. It provides a deep understanding of complex functions, residues, and contour integration, which have applications in various fields, including physics and engineering.

3. **Applications**: Complex analysis has practical applications in electrical engineering, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics, among others. If you are interested in these areas, complex analysis might be more immediately relevant.

**Learning Real Analysis Before Complex Analysis**:

1. **Sequential Learning**: Real analysis is often considered a foundational course in advanced mathematics. It provides a rigorous introduction to concepts such as limits, continuity, and convergence, which are applicable not only to real numbers but also to complex numbers. Learning real analysis first can provide a strong mathematical foundation.

2. **Mathematical Maturity**: Real analysis can help you develop mathematical maturity and proof-writing skills, which will be valuable when you tackle more advanced topics like complex analysis.

3. **Curriculum Sequence**: In many traditional mathematics curricula, real analysis is taught before complex analysis. Following a typical sequence can make it easier to find appropriate textbooks, courses, and resources.

In summary, there is no strict rule about whether to learn complex analysis before real analysis or the other way around. Both subjects are valuable and have their own merits. If you are interested in both, it may be worth starting with real analysis to build a strong mathematical foundation and then moving on to complex analysis. However, if you have a particular interest in complex numbers and their applications, learning complex analysis first can also be a rewarding choice. Ultimately, the decision should align with your mathematical goals and interests.
